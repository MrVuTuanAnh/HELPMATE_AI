 as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and a
                      configuration JSON file named *config.json* is found in the directory.
            state_dict (`Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                A state dictionary to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.

                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own
                weights. In this case though, you should check if using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and
                [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] is not a simpler option.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            from_tf (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a TensorFlow checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            from_flax (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a Flax checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            ignore_mismatched_sizes (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to raise an error if some of the weights from the checkpoint do not have the same size
                as the weights of the model (if for instance, you are instantiating a model with 10 labels from a
                checkpoint with 3 labels).
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            resume_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to delete incompletely received files. Will attempt to resume the download if such a
                file exists.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether ot not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.

                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>".

                </Tip>

            mirror (`str`, *optional*):
                Mirror source to accelerate downloads in China. If you are from China and have an accessibility
                problem, you can set this option to resolve it. Note that we do not guarantee the timeliness or safety.
                Please refer to the mirror site for more information.
            _fast_init(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Whether or not to disable fast initialization.

                <Tip warning={true}>

                One should only disable *_fast_init* to ensure backwards compatibility with `transformers.__version__ <
                4.6.0` for seeded model initialization. This argument will be removed at the next major version. See
                [pull request 11471](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/11471) for more information.

                </Tip>
            attn_implementation (`str`, *optional*):
                The attention implementation to use in the model (if relevant). Can be any of `"eager"` (manual implementation of the attention), `"sdpa"` (using [`F.scaled_dot_product_attention`](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html)), or `"flash_attention_2"` (using [Dao-AILab/flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)). By default, if available, SDPA will be used for torch>=2.1.1. The default is otherwise the manual `"eager"` implementation.

            > Parameters for big model inference

            low_cpu_mem_usage(`bool`, *optional*):
                Tries to not use more than 1x model size in CPU memory (including peak memory) while loading the model.
                This is an experimental feature and a subject to change at any moment.
            torch_dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
                Override the default `torch.dtype` and load the model under a specific `dtype`. The different options
                are:

                1. `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16` or `torch.float`: load in a specified
                  `dtype`, ignoring the model's `config.torch_dtype` if one exists. If not specified
                  - the model will get loaded in `torch.float` (fp32).

                2. `"auto"` - A `torch_dtype` entry in the `config.json` file of the model will be
                  attempted to be used. If this entry isn't found then next check the `dtype` of the first weight in
                  the checkpoint that's of a floating point type and use that as `dtype`. This will load the model
                  using the `dtype` it was saved in at the end of the training. It can't be used as an indicator of how
                  the model was trained. Since it could be trained in one of half precision dtypes, but saved in fp32.

                <Tip>

                For some models the `dtype` they were trained in is unknown - you may try to check the model's paper or
                reach out to the authors and ask them to add this information to the model's card and to insert the
                `torch_dtype` entry in `config.json` on the hub.

                </Tip>

            device_map (`str` or `Dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device]]` or `int` or `torch.device`, *optional*):
                A map that specifies where each submodule should go. It doesn't need to be refined to each
                parameter/buffer name, once a given module name is inside, every submodule of it will be sent to the
                same device. If we only pass the device (*e.g.*, `"cpu"`, `"cuda:1"`, `"mps"`, or a GPU ordinal rank
                like `1`) on which the model will be allocated, the device map will map the entire model to this
                device. Passing `device_map = 0` means put the whole model on GPU 0.

                To have Accelerate compute the most optimized `device_map` automatically, set `device_map="auto"`. For
                more information about each option see [designing a device
                map](https://hf.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map).
            max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
                A dictionary device identifier to maximum memory. Will default to the maximum memory available for each
                GPU and the available CPU RAM if unset.
            offload_folder (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                If the `device_map` contains any value `"disk"`, the folder where we will offload weights.
            offload_state_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
                If `True`, will temporarily offload the CPU state dict to the hard drive to avoid getting out of CPU
                RAM if the weight of the CPU state dict + the biggest shard of the checkpoint does not fit. Defaults to
                `True` when there is some disk offload.
            offload_buffers (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to offload the buffers with the model parameters.
            quantization_config (`Union[QuantizationConfigMixin,Dict]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of configuration parameters or a QuantizationConfigMixin object for quantization (e.g
                bitsandbytes, gptq). There may be other quantization-related kwargs, including `load_in_4bit` and
                `load_in_8bit`, which are parsed by QuantizationConfigParser. Supported only for bitsandbytes
                quantizations and not preferred. consider inserting all such arguments into quantization_config
                instead.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            variant (`str`, *optional*):
                If specified load weights from `variant` filename, *e.g.* pytorch_model.<variant>.bin. `variant` is
                ignored when using `from_tf` or `from_flax`.
            use_safetensors (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
                Whether or not to use `safetensors` checkpoints. Defaults to `None`. If not specified and `safetensors`
                is not installed, it will be set to `False`.

            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model (e.g.,
                `output_attentions=True`). Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or
                automatically loaded:

                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]). Each key of `kwargs` that
                      corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the
                      supplied `kwargs` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute
                      will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` function.

        <Tip>

        Activate the special ["offline-mode"](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html#offline-mode) to
        use this method in a firewalled environment.

        </Tip>

        Examples:

        ```python
        >>> from transformers import BertConfig, BertModel

        >>> # Download model and configuration from huggingface.co and cache.
        >>> model = BertModel.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased")
        >>> # Model was saved using *save_pretrained('./test/saved_model/')* (for example purposes, not runnable).
        >>> model = BertModel.from_pretrained("./test/saved_model/")
        >>> # Update configuration during loading.
        >>> model = BertModel.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased", output_attentions=True)
        >>> assert model.config.output_attentions == True
        >>> # Loading from a TF checkpoint file instead of a PyTorch model (slower, for example purposes, not runnable).
        >>> config = BertConfig.from_json_file("./tf_model/my_tf_model_config.json")
        >>> model = BertModel.from_pretrained("./tf_model/my_tf_checkpoint.ckpt.index", from_tf=True, config=config)
        >>> # Loading from a Flax checkpoint file instead of a PyTorch model (slower)
        >>> model = BertModel.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased", from_flax=True)
        ```

        * `low_cpu_mem_usage` algorithm:

        This is an experimental function that loads the model using ~1x model size CPU memory

        Here is how it works:

        1. save which state_dict keys we have
        2. drop state_dict before the model is created, since the latter takes 1x model size CPU memory
        3. after the model has been instantiated switch to the meta device all params/buffers that
        are going to be replaced from the loaded state_dict
        4. load state_dict 2nd time
        5. replace the params/buffers from the state_dict

        Currently, it can't handle deepspeed ZeRO stage 3 and ignores loading errors

        This is an experimental function that loads the model using ~1.x model size CPU memory

        Before you call it do:

        1. save which state_dict keys are available
        2. drop state_dict before model is created, since the latter takes 1x model size memory

        Here then we continue:

        3. switch to the meta device all params/buffers that are going to be replaced from the loaded state_dict
        4. load state_dict 2nd time
        5. replace the params/buffers from the state_dict

        Currently, it doesn't handle missing_keys, unexpected_keys, mismatched_keys. It can't handle deepspeed. To
        handle bitsandbytes, needs non-empty hf_quantizer argument.

        Converts the model to use [PyTorch's native attention
        implementation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MultiheadAttention.html), integrated to
        Transformers through [Optimum library](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/bettertransformer/overview). Only a
        subset of all Transformers models are supported.

        PyTorch's attention fastpath allows to speed up inference through kernel fusions and the use of [nested
        tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nested.html). Detailed benchmarks can be found in [this blog
        post](https://medium.com/pytorch/bettertransformer-out-of-the-box-performance-for-huggingface-transformers-3fbe27d50ab2).

        One of `start_states` or `start_positions` should be not `None`. If both are set, `start_positions` overrides
        `start_states`.

        </Tip>

        Returns:
            `torch.FloatTensor`: The SQuAD 2.0 answer class.

            The config used by the model. Relevant arguments in the config class of the model are (refer to the actual
            config class of your model for the default values it uses):

            - **summary_type** (`str`) -- The method to use to make this summary. Accepted values are:

                - `"last"` -- Take the last token hidden state (like XLNet)
                - `"first"` -- Take the first token hidden state (like Bert)
                - `"mean"` -- Take the mean of all tokens hidden states
                - `"cls_index"` -- Supply a Tensor of classification token position (GPT/GPT-2)
                - `"attn"` -- Not implemented now, use multi-head attention

            - **summary_use_proj** (`bool`) -- Add a projection after the vector extraction.
            - **summary_proj_to_labels** (`bool`) -- If `True`, the projection outputs to `config.num_labels` classes
              (otherwise to `config.hidden_size`).
            - **summary_activation** (`Optional[str]`) -- Set to `"tanh"` to add a tanh activation to the output,
              another string or `None` will add no activation.
            - **summary_first_dropout** (`float`) -- Optional dropout probability before the projection and activation.
            - **summary_last_dropout** (`float`)-- Optional dropout probability after the projection and activation.

        Compute a single vector summary of a sequence hidden states.

        Args:
            hidden_states (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `[batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size]`):
                The hidden states of the last layer.
            cls_index (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `[batch_size]` or `[batch_size, ...]` where ... are optional leading dimensions of `hidden_states`, *optional*):
                Used if `summary_type == "cls_index"` and takes the last token of the sequence as classification token.

        Returns:
            `torch.FloatTensor`: The summary of the sequence hidden states.

    Notes

    The probability density function for `ncf` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, n_1, n_2, \lambda) =
            \exp\left(\frac{\lambda}{2} +
                      \lambda n_1 \frac{x}{2(n_1 x + n_2)}
                \right)
            n_1^{n_1/2} n_2^{n_2/2} x^{n_1/2 - 1} \\
            (n_2 + n_1 x)^{-(n_1 + n_2)/2}
            \gamma(n_1/2) \gamma(1 + n_2/2) \\
            \frac{L^{\frac{n_1}{2}-1}_{n_2/2}
                \left(-\lambda n_1 \frac{x}{2(n_1 x + n_2)}\right)}
            {B(n_1/2, n_2/2)
                \gamma\left(\frac{n_1 + n_2}{2}\right)}

    for :math:`n_1, n_2 > 0`, :math:`\lambda \ge 0`.  Here :math:`n_1` is the
    degrees of freedom in the numerator, :math:`n_2` the degrees of freedom in
    the denominator, :math:`\lambda` the non-centrality parameter,
    :math:`\gamma` is the logarithm of the Gamma function, :math:`L_n^k` is a
    generalized Laguerre polynomial and :math:`B` is the beta function.

    `ncf` takes ``df1``, ``df2`` and ``nc`` as shape parameters. If ``nc=0``,
    the distribution becomes equivalent to the Fisher distribution.

    The probability density function for `t` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, \nu) = \frac{\Gamma((\nu+1)/2)}
                        {\sqrt{\pi \nu} \Gamma(\nu/2)}
                    (1+x^2/\nu)^{-(\nu+1)/2}

    where :math:`x` is a real number and the degrees of freedom parameter
    :math:`\nu` (denoted ``df`` in the implementation) satisfies
    :math:`\nu > 0`. :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function
    (`scipy.special.gamma`).

    If :math:`Y` is a standard normal random variable and :math:`V` is
    an independent chi-square random variable (`chi2`) with :math:`k` degrees
    of freedom, then

    .. math::

        X = \frac{Y + c}{\sqrt{V/k}}

    has a non-central Student's t distribution on the real line.
    The degrees of freedom parameter :math:`k` (denoted ``df`` in the

    :math:`c` (denoted ``nc`` in the implementation) is a real number.

    %(before_notes)s

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for `pareto` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, b) = \frac{b}{x^{b+1}}

    for :math:`x \ge 1`, :math:`b > 0`.

    `pareto` takes ``b`` as a shape parameter for :math:`b`.

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for `lomax` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, c) = \frac{c}{(1+x)^{c+1}}

    for :math:`x \ge 0`, :math:`c > 0`.

    `lomax` takes ``c`` as a shape parameter for :math:`c`.

    `lomax` is a special case of `pareto` with ``loc=-1.0``.

    The probability density function for `pearson3` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, \kappa) = \frac{|\beta|}{\Gamma(\alpha)}
                       (\beta (x - \zeta))^{\alpha - 1}
                       \exp(-\beta (x - \zeta))

    where:

    .. math::

            \beta = \frac{2}{\kappa}

            \alpha = \beta^2 = \frac{4}{\kappa^2}

            \zeta = -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = -\beta

    :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function (`scipy.special.gamma`).
    Pass the skew :math:`\kappa` into `pearson3` as the shape parameter
    ``skew``.

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for `powerlaw` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, a) = a x^{a-1}

    for :math:`0 \le x \le 1`, :math:`a > 0`.

    `powerlaw` takes ``a`` as a shape parameter for :math:`a`.

    %(after_notes)s

    For example, the support of `powerlaw` can be adjusted from the default
    interval ``[0, 1]`` to the interval ``[c, c+d]`` by setting ``loc=c`` and
    ``scale=d``. For a power-law distribution with infinite support, see
    `pareto`.

    `powerlaw` is a special case of `beta` with ``b=1``.

    The probability density function for `powerlognorm` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, c, s) = \frac{c}{x s} \phi(\log(x)/s)
                     (\Phi(-\log(x)/s))^{c-1}

    where :math:`\phi` is the normal pdf, and :math:`\Phi` is the normal cdf,
    and :math:`x > 0`, :math:`s, c > 0`.

    `powerlognorm` takes :math:`c` and :math:`s` as shape parameters.

    %(before_notes)s

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for `rdist` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, c) = \frac{(1-x^2)^{c/2-1}}{B(1/2, c/2)}

    for :math:`-1 \le x \le 1`, :math:`c > 0`. `rdist` is also called the
    symmetric beta distribution: if B has a `beta` distribution with
    parameters (c/2, c/2), then X = 2*B - 1 follows a R-distribution with
    parameter c.

    `rdist` takes ``c`` as a shape parameter for :math:`c`.

    This distribution includes the following distribution kernels as
    special cases::

        c = 2:  uniform
        c = 3:  `semicircular`
        c = 4:  Epanechnikov (parabolic)
        c = 6:  quartic (biweight)
        c = 8:  triweight

    The probability density function for this class is:

    .. math::

        f(x, a, b) = \frac{1}{x \log(b/a)}

    for :math:`a \le x \le b`, :math:`b > a > 0`. This class takes
    :math:`a` and :math:`b` as shape parameters.

    %(after_notes)s

    %(example)s

    This doesn't show the equal probability of ``0.01``, ``0.1`` and
    ``1``. This is best when the x-axis is log-scaled:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    >>> ax.hist(np.log10(r))
    >>> ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")
    >>> ax.set_xlabel("Value of random variable")
    >>> ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(plt.FixedLocator([-2, -1, 0]))
    >>> ticks = ["$10^{{ {} }}$".format(i) for i in [-2, -1, 0]]
    >>> ax.set_xticklabels(ticks)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.show()

    This random variable will be log-uniform regardless of the base chosen for
    ``a`` and ``b``. Let's specify with base ``2`` instead:

    >>> rvs = %(name)s(2**-2, 2**0).rvs(size=1000)

    Values of ``1/4``, ``1/2`` and ``1`` are equally likely with this random
    variable.  Here's the histogram:

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    >>> ax.hist(np.log2(rvs))
    >>> ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")
    >>> ax.set_xlabel("Value of random variable")
    >>> ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(plt.FixedLocator([-2, -1, 0]))
    >>> ticks = ["$2^{{ {} }}$".format(i) for i in [-2, -1, 0]]
    >>> ax.set_xticklabels(ticks)  # doctest: +SKIP

    The probability density function for `rice` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, b) = x \exp(- \frac{x^2 + b^2}{2}) I_0(x b)

    for :math:`x >= 0`, :math:`b > 0`. :math:`I_0` is the modified Bessel
    function of order zero (`scipy.special.i0`).

    `rice` takes ``b`` as a shape parameter for :math:`b`.

    %(after_notes)s

    The Rice distribution describes the length, :math:`r`, of a 2-D vector with
    components :math:`(U+u, V+v)`, where :math:`U, V` are constant, :math:`u,
    v` are independent Gaussian random variables with standard deviation
    :math:`s`.  Let :math:`R = \sqrt{U^2 + V^2}`. Then the pdf of :math:`r` is
    ``rice.pdf(x, R/s, scale=s)``.

    The probability density function for `skewcauchy` is:

    .. math::

        f(x) = \frac{1}{\pi \left(\frac{x^2}{\left(a\, \text{sign}(x) + 1
                                                   \right)^2} + 1 \right)}

    for a real number :math:`x` and skewness parameter :math:`-1 < a < 1`.

    When :math:`a=0`, the distribution reduces to the usual Cauchy
    distribution.

    The pdf is::

        skewnorm.pdf(x, a) = 2 * norm.pdf(x) * norm.cdf(a*x)

    `skewnorm` takes a real number :math:`a` as a skewness parameter
    When ``a = 0`` the distribution is identical to a normal distribution
    (`norm`). `rvs` implements the method of [1]_.

        remaining parameters are used to match distribution and sample moments
        where possible. For example, if the user fixes the location with
        ``floc``, the parameters will only match the distribution skewness and
        variance to the sample skewness and variance; no attempt will be made
        to match the means or minimize a norm of the errors.
        Note that the maximum possible skewness magnitude of a
        `scipy.stats.skewnorm` distribution is approximately 0.9952717; if the
        magnitude of the data's sample skewness exceeds this, the returned
        shape parameter ``a`` will be infinite.

Útrapezoid_gena›  A trapezoidal continuous random variable.

    %(before_notes)s

    Notes
    -----
    The trapezoidal distribution can be represented with an up-sloping line
    from ``loc`` to ``(loc + c*scale)``, then constant to ``(loc + d*scale)``
    and then downsloping from ``(loc + d*scale)`` to ``(loc+scale)``.  This
    defines the trapezoid base from ``loc`` to ``(loc+scale)`` and the flat
    top from ``c`` to ``d`` proportional to the position along the base
    with ``0 <= c <= d <= 1``.  When ``c=d``, this is equivalent to `triang`
    with the same values for `loc`, `scale` and `c`.
    The method of [1]_ is used for computing moments.

    `trapezoid` takes :math:`c` and :math:`d` as shape parameters.

    %(after_notes)s

    The standard form is in the range [0, 1] with c the mode.
    The location parameter shifts the start to `loc`.
    The scale parameter changes the width from 1 to `scale`.

    The probability density function for `truncexpon` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, b) = \frac{\exp(-x)}{1 - \exp(-b)}

    for :math:`0 <= x <= b`.

    `truncexpon` takes ``b`` as a shape parameter for :math:`b`.

  A truncated normal continuous random variable.

    %(before_notes)s

    Notes
    -----
    This distribution is the normal distribution centered on ``loc`` (default
    0), with standard deviation ``scale`` (default 1), and truncated at ``a``
    and ``b`` *standard deviations* from ``loc``. For arbitrary ``loc`` and
    ``scale``, ``a`` and ``b`` are *not* the abscissae at which the shifted
    and scaled distribution is truncated.

    .. note::
        If ``a_trunc`` and ``b_trunc`` are the abscissae at which we wish
        to truncate the distribution (as opposed to the number of standard
        deviations from ``loc``), then we can calculate the distribution
        parameters ``a`` and ``b`` as follows::

            a, b = (a_trunc - loc) / scale, (b_trunc - loc) / scale

        This is a common point of confusion. For additional clarification,
        please see the example below.

    %(example)s

    In the examples above, ``loc=0`` and ``scale=1``, so the plot is truncated
    at ``a`` on the left and ``b`` on the right. However, suppose we were to
    produce the same histogram with ``loc = 1`` and ``scale=0.5``.

    >>> loc, scale = 1, 0.5
    >>> rv = truncnorm(a, b, loc=loc, scale=scale)
    >>> x = np.linspace(truncnorm.ppf(0.01, a, b),
    ...                 truncnorm.ppf(0.99, a, b), 100)
    >>> r = rv.rvs(size=1000)

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    >>> ax.plot(x, rv.pdf(x), 'k-', lw=2, label='frozen pdf')
    >>> ax.hist(r, density=True, bins='auto', histtype='stepfilled', alpha=0.2)
    >>> ax.set_xlim(a, b)
    >>> ax.legend(loc='best', frameon=False)
    >>> plt.show()

    Note that the distribution is no longer appears to be truncated at
    abscissae ``a`` and ``b``. That is because the *standard* normal
    distribution is first truncated at ``a`` and ``b``, *then* the resulting
    distribution is scaled by ``scale`` and shifted by ``loc``. If we instead
    want the shifted and scaled distribution to be truncated at ``a`` and
    ``b``, we need to transform these values before passing them as the
    distribution parameters.

    >>> a_transformed, b_transformed = (a - loc) / scale, (b - loc) / scale
    >>> rv = truncnorm(a_transformed, b_transformed, loc=loc, scale=scale)
    >>> x = np.linspace(truncnorm.ppf(0.01, a, b),
    ...                 truncnorm.ppf(0.99, a, b), 100)
    >>> r = rv.rvs(size=10000)

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    >>> ax.plot(x, rv.pdf(x), 'k-', lw=2, label='frozen pdf')
    >>> ax.hist(r, density=True, bins='auto', histtype='stepfilled', alpha=0.2)
    >>> ax.set_xlim(a-0.1, b+0.1)
    >>> ax.legend(loc='best', frameon=False)
    >>> plt.show()

    pareto : Pareto distribution

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for `truncpareto` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, b, c) = \frac{b}{1 - c^{-b}} \frac{1}{x^{b+1}}

    for :math:`b > 0`, :math:`c > 1` and :math:`1 \le x \le c`.

    `truncpareto` takes `b` and `c` as shape parameters for :math:`b` and
    :math:`c`.

    Notice that the upper truncation value :math:`c` is defined in
    standardized form so that random values of an unscaled, unshifted variable
    are within the range ``[1, c]``.
    If ``u_r`` is the upper bound to a scaled and/or shifted variable,
    then ``c = (u_r - loc) / scale``. In other words, the support of the
    distribution becomes ``(scale + loc) <= x <= (c*scale + loc)`` when
    `scale` and/or `loc` are provided.

Útukeylambda_gena*  A Tukey-Lamdba continuous random variable.

    %(before_notes)s

    Notes
    -----
    A flexible distribution, able to represent and interpolate between the
    following distributions:

    - Cauchy                (:math:`lambda = -1`)
    - logistic              (:math:`lambda = 0`)
    - approx Normal         (:math:`lambda = 0.14`)
    - uniform from -1 to 1  (:math:`lambda = 1`)

    `tukeylambda` takes a real number :math:`lambda` (denoted ``lam``
    in the implementation) as a shape parameter.

        Maximum likelihood estimate for the location and scale parameters.

        `uniform.fit` uses only the following parameters.  Because exact
        formulas are used, the parameters related to optimization that are
        available in the `fit` method of other distributions are ignored
        here.  The only positional argument accepted is `data`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : array_like
            Data to use in calculating the maximum likelihood estimate.
        floc : float, optional
            Hold the location parameter fixed to the specified value.
        fscale : float, optional
            Hold the scale parameter fixed to the specified value.

        Returns
        -------
        loc, scale : float
            Maximum likelihood estimates for the location and scale.

        An error is raised if `floc` is given and any values in `data` are
        less than `floc`, or if `fscale` is given and `fscale` is less
        than ``data.max() - data.min()``.  An error is also raised if both
        `floc` and `fscale` are given.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scipy.stats import uniform

        We'll fit the uniform distribution to `x`:

        >>> x = np.array([2, 2.5, 3.1, 9.5, 13.0])

        For a uniform distribution MLE, the location is the minimum of the
        data, and the scale is the maximum minus the minimum.

        >>> loc, scale = uniform.fit(x)
        >>> loc
        2.0
        >>> scale
        11.0

        If we know the data comes from a uniform distribution where the support
        starts at 0, we can use `floc=0`:

        >>> loc, scale = uniform.fit(x, floc=0)
        >>> loc
        0.0
        >>> scale
        13.0

        Alternatively, if we know the length of the support is 12, we can use
        `fscale=12`:

        >>> loc, scale = uniform.fit(x, fscale=12)
        >>> loc
        1.5
        >>> scale
        12.0

        In that last example, the support interval is [1.5, 13.5].  This
        solution is not unique.  For example, the distribution with ``loc=2``
        and ``scale=12`` has the same likelihood as the one above.  When
        `fscale` is given and it is larger than ``data.max() - data.min()``,
        the parameters returned by the `fit` method center the support over
        the interval ``[data.min(), data.max()]``.

    --------
    scipy.stats.vonmises_fisher : Von-Mises Fisher distribution on a
                                  hypersphere

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for `vonmises` and `vonmises_line` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, \kappa) = \frac{ \exp(\kappa \cos(x)) }{ 2 \pi I_0(\kappa) }

    for :math:`-\pi \le x \le \pi`, :math:`\kappa \ge 0`. :math:`I_0` is the
    modified Bessel function of order zero (`scipy.special.i0`).

    `vonmises` is a circular distribution which does not restrict the
    distribution to a fixed interval. Currently, there is no circular
    distribution framework in SciPy. The ``cdf`` is implemented such that
    ``cdf(x + 2*np.pi) == cdf(x) + 1``.

    `vonmises_line` is the same distribution, defined on :math:`[-\pi, \pi]`
    on the real line. This is a regular (i.e. non-circular) distribution.

    Note about distribution parameters: `vonmises` and `vonmises_line` take
    ``kappa`` as a shape parameter (concentration) and ``loc`` as the location
    (circular mean). A ``scale`` parameter is accepted but does not have any
    effect.

    Examples
    --------
    Import the necessary modules.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from scipy.stats import vonmises

    Define distribution parameters.

    >>> loc = 0.5 * np.pi  # circular mean
    >>> kappa = 1  # concentration

    Compute the probability density at ``x=0`` via the ``pdf`` method.

    >>> vonmises.pdf(0, loc=loc, kappa=kappa)
    0.12570826359722018

    Verify that the percentile function ``ppf`` inverts the cumulative
    distribution function ``cdf`` up to floating point accuracy.

    >>> x = 1
    >>> cdf_value = vonmises.cdf(x, loc=loc, kappa=kappa)
    >>> ppf_value = vonmises.ppf(cdf_value, loc=loc, kappa=kappa)
    >>> x, cdf_value, ppf_value
    (1, 0.31489339900904967, 1.0000000000000004)

    Draw 1000 random variates by calling the ``rvs`` method.

    >>> sample_size = 1000
    >>> sample = vonmises(loc=loc, kappa=kappa).rvs(sample_size)

    Plot the von Mises density on a Cartesian and polar grid to emphasize
    that it is a circular distribution.

    >>> fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
    >>> left = plt.subplot(121)
    >>> right = plt.subplot(122, projection='polar')
    >>> x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 500)
    >>> vonmises_pdf = vonmises.pdf(x, loc=loc, kappa=kappa)
    >>> ticks = [0, 0.15, 0.3]

    The left image contains the Cartesian plot.

    >>> left.plot(x, vonmises_pdf)
    >>> left.set_yticks(ticks)
    >>> number_of_bins = int(np.sqrt(sample_size))
    >>> left.hist(sample, density=True, bins=number_of_bins)
    >>> left.set_title("Cartesian plot")
    >>> left.set_xlim(-np.pi, np.pi)
    >>> left.grid(True)

    The right image contains the polar plot.

    >>> right.plot(x, vonmises_pdf, label="PDF")
    >>> right.set_yticks(ticks)
    >>> right.hist(sample, density=True, bins=number_of_bins,
    ...            label="Histogram")
    >>> right.set_title("Polar plot")
    >>> right.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(0.15, 1.06))

    The probability density function for `wald` is:

    .. math::

        f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi x^3}} \exp(- \frac{ (x-1)^2 }{ 2x })

    for :math:`x >= 0`.

    `wald` is a special case of `invgauss` with ``mu=1``.

    The probability density function for `gennorm` is [1]_:

    .. math::

        f(x, \beta) = \frac{\beta}{2 \Gamma(1/\beta)} \exp(-|x|^\beta),

    where :math:`x` is a real number, :math:`\beta > 0` and
    :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function (`scipy.special.gamma`).

    `gennorm` takes ``beta`` as a shape parameter for :math:`\beta`.
    For :math:`\beta = 1`, it is identical to a Laplace distribution.
    For :math:`\beta = 2`, it is identical to a normal distribution
    (with ``scale=1/sqrt(2)``).

    Notes

    The probability density function for `halfgennorm` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, \beta) = \frac{\beta}{\Gamma(1/\beta)} \exp(-|x|^\beta)

    for :math:`x, \beta > 0`. :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function
    (`scipy.special.gamma`).

    `halfgennorm` takes ``beta`` as a shape parameter for :math:`\beta`.
    For :math:`\beta = 1`, it is identical to an exponential distribution.
    For :math:`\beta = 2`, it is identical to a half normal distribution
    (with ``scale=1/sqrt(2)``).

    Notes

    The probability density function for `crystalball` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, \beta, m) =  \begin{cases}
                            N \exp(-x^2 / 2),  &\text{for } x > -\beta\\
                            N A (B - x)^{-m}  &\text{for } x \le -\beta
                          \end{cases}

    where :math:`A = (m / |\beta|)^m  \exp(-\beta^2 / 2)`,
    :math:`B = m/|\beta| - |\beta|` and :math:`N` is a normalisation constant.

    `crystalball` takes :math:`\beta > 0` and :math:`m > 1` as shape
    parameters.  :math:`\beta` defines the point where the pdf changes
    from a power-law to a Gaussian distribution.  :math:`m` is the power
    of the power-law tail.

    Utility function for the argus distribution used in the pdf, sf and
    moment calculation.
    Note that for all x > 0:
    gammainc(1.5, x**2/2) = 2 * (_norm_cdf(x) - x * _norm_pdf(x) - 0.5).
    This can be verified directly by noting that the cdf of Gamma(1.5) can
    be written as erf(sqrt(x)) - 2*sqrt(x)*exp(-x)/sqrt(Pi).
    We use gammainc instead of the usual definition because it is more precise
    for small chi.

    Argus distribution

    %(before_notes)s

    Notes
    -----
    The probability density function for `argus` is:

    .. math::

        f(x, \chi) = \frac{\chi^3}{\sqrt{2\pi} \Psi(\chi)} x \sqrt{1-x^2}
                     \exp(-\chi^2 (1 - x^2)/2)

    for :math:`0 < x < 1` and :math:`\chi > 0`, where

    .. math::

        \Psi(\chi) = \Phi(\chi) - \chi \phi(\chi) - 1/2

    with :math:`\Phi` and :math:`\phi` being the CDF and PDF of a standard
    normal distribution, respectively.

    `argus` takes :math:`\chi` as shape a parameter. Details about sampling
    from the ARGUS distribution can be found in [2]_.

    Generates a distribution given by a histogram.
    This is useful to generate a template distribution from a binned
    datasample.

    As a subclass of the `rv_continuous` class, `rv_histogram` inherits from it
    a collection of generic methods (see `rv_continuous` for the full list),
    and implements them based on the properties of the provided binned
    datasample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    histogram : tuple of array_like
        Tuple containing two array_like objects.
        The first containing the content of n bins,
        the second containing the (n+1) bin boundaries.
        In particular, the return value of `numpy.histogram` is accepted.

    density : bool, optional
        If False, assumes the histogram is proportional to counts per bin;
        otherwise, assumes it is proportional to a density.
        For constant bin widths, these are equivalent, but the distinction
        is important when bin widths vary (see Notes).
        If None (default), sets ``density=True`` for backwards compatibility,
        but warns if the bin widths are variable. Set `density` explicitly
        to silence the warning.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    Notes
    -----
    When a histogram has unequal bin widths, there is a distinction between
    histograms that are proportional to counts per bin and histograms that are
    proportional to probability density over a bin. If `numpy.histogram` is
    called with its default ``density=False``, the resulting histogram is the
    number of counts per bin, so ``density=False`` should be passed to
    `rv_histogram`. If `numpy.histogram` is called with ``density=True``, the
    resulting histogram is in terms of probability density, so ``density=True``
    should be passed to `rv_histogram`. To avoid warnings, always pass
    ``density`` explicitly when the input histogram has unequal bin widths.

    There are no additional shape parameters except for the loc and scale.
    The pdf is defined as a stepwise function from the provided histogram.
    The cdf is a linear interpolation of the pdf.

    .. versionadded:: 0.19.0

    Examples
    --------

    Create a scipy.stats distribution from a numpy histogram

    >>> import scipy.stats
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = scipy.stats.norm.rvs(size=100000, loc=0, scale=1.5,
    ...                             random_state=123)
    >>> hist = np.histogram(data, bins=100)
    >>> hist_dist = scipy.stats.rv_histogram(hist, density=False)

    Behaves like an ordinary scipy rv_continuous distribution

    >>> hist_dist.pdf(1.0)
    0.20538577847618705
    >>> hist_dist.cdf(2.0)
    0.90818568543056499

    PDF is zero above (below) the highest (lowest) bin of the histogram,
    defined by the max (min) of the original dataset

    >>> hist_dist.pdf(np.max(data))
    0.0
    >>> hist_dist.cdf(np.max(data))
    1.0
    >>> hist_dist.pdf(np.min(data))
    7.7591907244498314e-05
    >>> hist_dist.cdf(np.min(data))
    0.0

    PDF and CDF follow the histogram

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> X = np.linspace(-5.0, 5.0, 100)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> ax.set_title("PDF from Template")
    >>> ax.hist(data, density=True, bins=100)
    >>> ax.plot(X, hist_dist.pdf(X), label='PDF')
    >>> ax.plot(X, hist_dist.cdf(X), label='CDF')
    >>> ax.legend()
    >>> fig.show()

                        [\Phi(sx + z) - \Phi(z)]^{k-2} \,dz \,ds

    for :math:`x â‰¥ 0`, :math:`k > 1`, and :math:`\nu > 0`.

    `studentized_range` takes ``k`` for :math:`k` and ``df`` for :math:`\nu`
    as shape parameters.

    When :math:`\nu` exceeds 100,000, an asymptotic approximation (infinite
    degrees of freedom) is used to compute the cumulative distribution
    function [4]_ and probability distribution function.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import studentized_range
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)

    Calculate the first four moments:

    >>> k, df = 3, 10
    >>> mean, var, skew, kurt = studentized_range.stats(k, df, moments='mvsk')

    Display the probability density function (``pdf``):

    >>> x = np.linspace(studentized_range.ppf(0.01, k, df),
    ...                 studentized_range.ppf(0.99, k, df), 100)
    >>> ax.plot(x, studentized_range.pdf(x, k, df),
    ...         'r-', lw=5, alpha=0.6, label='studentized_range pdf')

    Alternatively, the distribution object can be called (as a function)
    to fix the shape, location and scale parameters. This returns a "frozen"
    RV object holding the given parameters fixed.

    Freeze the distribution and display the frozen ``pdf``:

    >>> rv = studentized_range(k, df)
    >>> ax.plot(x, rv.pdf(x), 'k-', lw=2, label='frozen pdf')

    Check accuracy of ``cdf`` and ``ppf``:

    >>> vals = studentized_range.ppf([0.001, 0.5, 0.999], k, df)
    >>> np.allclose([0.001, 0.5, 0.999], studentized_range.cdf(vals, k, df))
    True

    Rather than using (``studentized_range.rvs``) to generate random variates,
    which is very slow for this distribution, we can approximate the inverse
    CDF using an interpolator, and then perform inverse transform sampling
    with this approximate inverse CDF.

    This distribution has an infinite but thin right tail, so we focus our
    attention on the leftmost 99.9 percent.

    >>> a, b = studentized_range.ppf([0, .999], k, df)
    >>> a, b
    0, 7.41058083802274

    >>> from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> xs = np.linspace(a, b, 50)
    >>> cdf = studentized_range.cdf(xs, k, df)
    # Create an interpolant of the inverse CDF
    >>> ppf = interp1d(cdf, xs, fill_value='extrapolate')
    # Perform inverse transform sampling using the interpolant
    >>> r = ppf(rng.uniform(size=1000))

    And compare the histogram:

    >>> ax.hist(r, density=True, histtype='stepfilled', alpha=0.2)
    >>> ax.legend(loc='best', frameon=False)
    >>> plt.show()

    cauchy: Cauchy distribution, also known as the Breit-Wigner distribution.

    Notes
    -----

    The probability density function for `rel_breitwigner` is

    .. math::

        f(x, \rho) = \frac{k}{(x^2 - \rho^2)^2 + \rho^2}

    where

    .. math::
        k = \frac{2\sqrt{2}\rho^2\sqrt{\rho^2 + 1}}
            {\pi\sqrt{\rho^2 + \rho\sqrt{\rho^2 + 1}}}

    The relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution is used in high energy physics
    to model resonances [1]_. It gives the uncertainty in the invariant mass,
    :math:`M` [2]_, of a resonance with characteristic mass :math:`M_0` and
    decay-width :math:`\Gamma`, where :math:`M`, :math:`M_0` and :math:`\Gamma`
    are expressed in natural units. In SciPy's parametrization, the shape
    parameter :math:`\rho` is equal to :math:`M_0/\Gamma` and takes values in
    :math:`(0, \infty)`.

    Equivalently, the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution is said to give
    the uncertainty in the center-of-mass energy :math:`E_{\text{cm}}`. In
    natural units, the speed of light :math:`c` is equal to 1 and the invariant
    mass :math:`M` is equal to the rest energy :math:`Mc^2`. In the
    center-of-mass frame, the rest energy is equal to the total energy [3]_.

    %(after_notes)s

    :math:`\rho = M/\Gamma` and :math:`\Gamma` is the scale parameter. For
    example, if one seeks to model the :math:`Z^0` boson with :math:`M_0
    \approx 91.1876 \text{ GeV}` and :math:`\Gamma \approx 2.4952\text{ GeV}`
    [4]_ one can set ``rho=91.1876/2.4952`` and ``scale=2.4952``.

    To ensure a physically meaningful result when using the `fit` method, one
    should set ``floc=0`` to fix the location parameter to 0.

    Wrapper class for struct `fz_storable`.
    Resource store

    MuPDF stores decoded "objects" into a store for potential reuse.
    If the size of the store gets too big, objects stored within it
    can be evicted and freed to recover space. When MuPDF comes to
    decode such an object, it will check to see if a version of this
    object is already in the store - if it is, it will simply reuse
    it. If not, it will decode it and place it into the store.

    All objects that can be placed into the store are derived from
    the fz_storable type (i.e. this should be the first component of
    the objects structure). This allows for consistent (thread safe)
    reference counting, and includes a function that will be called
    to free the object as soon as the reference count reaches zero.

    Most objects offer fz_keep_XXXX/fz_drop_XXXX functions derived
    from fz_keep_storable/fz_drop_storable. Creation of such objects
    includes a call to FZ_INIT_STORABLE to set up the fz_storable
    header.

ÚFzStoreHashaw
  
    Wrapper class for struct `fz_store_hash`. Not copyable or assignable.
    The store can be seen as a dictionary that maps keys to
    fz_storable values. In order to allow keys of different types to
    be stored, we have a structure full of functions for each key
    'type'; this fz_store_type pointer is stored with each key, and
    tells the store how to perform certain operations (like taking/
    dropping a reference, comparing two keys, outputting details for
    debugging etc).

    The store uses a hash table internally for speed where possible.
    In order for this to work, we need a mechanism for turning a
    generic 'key' into 'a hashable string'. For this purpose the
    type structure contains a make_hash_key function pointer that
    maps from a void * to a fz_store_hash structure. If
    make_hash_key function returns 0, then the key is determined not
    to be hashable, and the value is not stored in the hash table.

    Some objects can be used both as values within the store, and as
    a component of keys within the store. We refer to these objects
    as "key storable" objects. In this case, we need to take
    additional care to ensure that we do not end up keeping an item
    within the store, purely because its value is referred to by
    another key in the store.

    An example of this are fz_images in PDF files. Each fz_image is
    placed into the	store to enable it to be easily reused. When the
    image is rendered, a pixmap is generated from the image, and the
    pixmap is placed into the store so it can be reused on
    subsequent renders. The image forms part of the key for the
    pixmap.

    When we close the pdf document (and any associated pages/display
    lists etc), we drop the images from the store. This may leave us
    in the position of the images having non-zero reference counts
    purely because they are used as part of the keys for the
    pixmaps.

    We therefore use special reference counting functions to keep
    track of these "key storable" items, and hence store the number
    of references to these items that are used in keys.

    When the number of references to an object == the number of
    references to an object from keys in the store, we know that we
    can remove all the items which have that object as part of the
    key. This is done by running a pass over the store, 'reaping'
    those items.

    Reap passes are slower than we would like as they touch every
    item in the store. We therefore provide a way to 'batch' such
    reap passes together, using fz_defer_reap_start/
    fz_defer_reap_end to bracket a region in which many may be
    triggered.

    Wrapper class for struct `fz_stream`.
    fz_stream is a buffered reader capable of seeking in both
    directions.

    Streams are reference counted, so references must be dropped
    by a call to fz_drop_stream.

    Only the data between rp and wp is valid.

        Class-aware wrapper for `::fz_available()`.
        	Ask how many bytes are available immediately from
        	a given stream.

        	stm: The stream to read from.

        	max: A hint for the underlying stream; the maximum number of
        	bytes that we are sure we will want to read. If you do not know
        	this number, give 1.

        	Returns the number of bytes immediately available between the
        	read and write pointers. This number is guaranteed only to be 0
        	if we have hit EOF. The number of bytes returned here need have
        	no relation to max (could be larger, could be smaller).

        Class-aware wrapper for `::fz_decomp_image_from_stream()`.

        This method has out-params. Python/C# wrappers look like:
        	`fz_decomp_image_from_stream(::fz_compressed_image *image, ::fz_irect *subarea, int indexed, int l2factor)` => `(fz_pixmap *, int l2extra)`

        	Decode a subarea of a compressed image. l2factor is the amount
        	of subsampling inbuilt to the stream (i.e. performed by the
        	decoder). If non NULL, l2extra is the extra amount of
        	subsampling that should be performed by this routine. This will
        	be updated on exit to the amount of subsampling that is still
        	required to be done.

        	Returns a kept reference.

    Class-aware wrapper for `::fz_getopt_long()`.

    	`fz_getopt_long(int nargc, const char *ostr, const ::fz_getopt_long_options *longopts)` => `(int, char *nargv)`

    	Simple functions/variables for use in tools.

    	ostr = option string. Comprises single letter options, followed by : if there
    	is an argument to the option.

    	longopts: NULL (indicating no long options), or a pointer to an array of
    	longoptions, terminated by an entry with option == NULL.

    	In the event of matching a single char option, this function will normally
    	return the char. The exception to this is when the option requires an
    	argument and none is supplied; in this case we return ':'.

    	In the event of matching a long option, this function returns 0, with fz_optlong
    	set to point to the matching option.

    	A long option entry may be followed with : to indicate there is an argument to the
    	option. If the need for an argument is specified in this way, and no argument is
    	given, an error will be displayed and argument processing will stop. If an argument
    	is given, and the long option record contains a non-null flag pointer, then the code
    	will decode the argument and fill in that flag pointer. Specifically,
    	case-insensitive matches to 'yes', 'no', 'true' and 'false' will cause a value of 0
    	or 1 as appropriate to be written; failing this the arg will be interpreted as a
    	decimal integer using atoi.

    	A long option entry may be followed by an list of options (e.g. myoption=foo|bar|baz)
    	and the option will be passed to fz_opt_from_list. The return value of that will be
    	placed in fz_optitem. If the return value of that function is -1, then an error will
    	be displayed and argument processing will stop.

    	In the event of reaching the end of the arg list or '--', this function returns EOF.

    	In the event of failing to match anything, an error is printed, and we return '?'.

    	If an argument is expected for the option, then fz_optarg will be returned pointing
    	at the start of the argument. Examples of supported argument formats: '-r500', '-r 500',
    	'--resolution 500', '--resolution=500'.

    	target: The target device to receive the OCRd text.

    	ctm: The transform to apply to the mediabox to get the size for
    	the rendered page image. Also used to calculate the resolution
    	for the page image. In general, this will be the same as the CTM
    	that you pass to fz_run_page (or fz_run_display_list) to feed
    	this device.

    	mediabox: The mediabox (in points). Combined with the CTM to get
    	the bounds of the pixmap used internally for the rendered page
    	image.

    	with_list: If with_list is false, then all non-text operations
    	are forwarded instantly to the target device. This results in
    	the target device seeing all NON-text operations, followed by
    	all the text operations (derived from OCR).

    	If with_list is true, then all the marking operations are
    	collated into a display list which is then replayed to the
    	target device at the end.

    	language: NULL (for "eng"), or a pointer to a string to describe
    	the languages/scripts that should be used for OCR (e.g.
    	"eng,ara").

    	datadir: NULL (for ""), or a pointer to a path string otherwise
    	provided to Tesseract in the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable.

    	progress: NULL, or function to be called periodically to indicate
    	progress. Return 0 to continue, or 1 to cancel. progress_arg is
    	returned as the void *. The int is a value between 0 and 100 to

    	pack: Pointer to a block of data to pack the path into. Should
    	be aligned by the caller to the same alignment as required for
    	a fz_path pointer.

    	path: The path to pack.

    	Returns the number of bytes within the block used. Callers can
    	access the packed path data by casting the value of pack on
    	entry to be a fz_path *.

    	Throws exceptions on failure to allocate.

    	Implementation details: Paths can be 'unpacked', 'flat', or
    	'open'. Standard paths, as created are 'unpacked'. Paths
    	will be packed as 'flat', unless they are too large
    	(where large indicates that they exceed some private
    	implementation defined limits, currently including having
    	more than 256 coordinates or commands).

    	Large paths are 'open' packed as a header into the given block,
    	plus pointers to other data blocks.

    	Users should not have to care about whether paths are 'open'
    	or 'flat' packed. Simply pack a path (if required), and then

    	provided callback for each page for processing. If the callback
    	returns non-NULL then the iteration stops and that value is returned
    	to the called of fz_process_opened_pages().

    	The state pointer provided to fz_process_opened_pages() is
    	passed on to the callback but is owned by the caller.

    	Returns the first non-NULL value returned by the callback,
    	or NULL if the callback returned NULL for all opened pages.

    Shows an exception and/or backtrace.

    Alternative to `traceback.*` functions that print/return information about
    exceptions and backtraces, such as:

        * `traceback.format_exc()`
        * `traceback.format_exception()`
        * `traceback.print_exc()`
        * `traceback.print_exception()`

    Install as system default with:

        `sys.excepthook = lambda type_, exception, traceback: jlib.exception_info( exception)`

    Returns `None`, or the generated text if `file` is 'return'.

    Args:
        exception_or_traceback:
            `None`, a `BaseException`, a `types.TracebackType` (typically from
            an exception's `.__traceback__` member) or an `inspect.FrameInfo`.

            If `None` we use current exception from `sys.exc_info()` if set,
            otherwise the current backtrace from `inspect.stack()`.
        limit:
            As in `traceback.*` functions: `None` to show all frames, positive
            to show last `limit` frames, negative to exclude outermost `-limit`
            frames. Zero to not show any backtraces.
        file:
            As in `traceback.*` functions: file-like object to which we write
            output, or `sys.stderr` if `None`. Special value 'return' makes us
            return our output as a string.
        chain:
            As in `traceback.*` functions: if true (the default) we show
            chained exceptions as described in PEP-3134. Special value
            'because' reverses the usual ordering, showing higher-level
            exceptions first and joining with 'Because:' text.
        outer:
            If true (the default) we also show an exception's outer frames
            above the `catch` block (see next section for details). We
            use `outer=false` internally for chained exceptions to avoid
            duplication.
        show_exception_type:
            Controls whether exception text is prefixed by
            `f'{type(exception)}: '`. If callable we only include this prefix
            if `show_exception_type(exception)` is true. Otherwise if true (the
            default) we include the prefix for all exceptions (this mimcs the
            behaviour of `traceback.*` functions). Otherwise we exclude the
            prefix for all exceptions.
        _filelinefn:
            Internal only; makes us omit file:line: information to allow simple
            doctest comparison with expected output.

    Differences from `traceback.*` functions:

        Frames are displayed as one line in the form::

            <file>:<line>:<function>: <text>

        Filenames are displayed as relative to the current directory if
        applicable.

        Inclusion of outer frames:
            Unlike `traceback.*` functions, stack traces for exceptions include
            outer stack frames above the point at which an exception was caught
            - i.e. frames from the top-level <module> or thread creation to the
            catch block. [Search for 'sys.exc_info backtrace incomplete' for
            more details.]

            We separate the two parts of the backtrace using a marker line
            '^except raise:' where '^except' points upwards to the frame that
            caught the exception and 'raise:' refers downwards to the frame
            that raised the exception.

            So the backtrace for an exception looks like this::

                <file>:<line>:<fn>: <text>  [in root module.]
                ...                         [... other frames]
                <file>:<line>:<fn>: <text>  [in except: block where exception was caught.]
                ^except raise:              [marker line]
                <file>:<line>:<fn>: <text>  [in try: block.]
                ...                         [... other frames]
                <file>:<line>:<fn>: <text>  [where the exception was raised.]

    Examples:

        In these examples we use `file=sys.stdout` so we can check the output
        with `doctest`, and set `_filelinefn=0` so that the output can be
        matched easily. We also use `+ELLIPSIS` and `...` to match arbitrary
        outer frames from the doctest code itself.

        Basic handling of an exception:

            >>> def c():
            ...     raise Exception( 'c() failed')
            >>> def b():
            ...     try:
            ...         c()
            ...     except Exception as e:
            ...         exception_info( e, file=sys.stdout, _filelinefn=0)
            >>> def a():
            ...     b()

            >>> a() # doctest: +REPORT_UDIFF +ELLIPSIS
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
                a(): b()
                b(): exception_info( e, file=sys.stdout, _filelinefn=0)
                ^except raise:
                b(): c()
                c(): raise Exception( 'c() failed')
            Exception: c() failed

        Handling of chained exceptions:

            >>> def e():
            ...     raise Exception( 'e(): deliberate error')
            >>> def d():
            ...     e()
            >>> def c():
            ...     try:
            ...         d()
            ...     except Exception as e:
            ...         raise Exception( 'c: d() failed') from e
            >>> def b():
            ...     try:
            ...         c()
            ...     except Exception as e:
            ...         exception_info( file=sys.stdout, chain=g_chain, _filelinefn=0)
            >>> def a():
            ...     b()

            With `chain=True` (the default), we output low-level exceptions
            first, matching the behaviour of `traceback.*` functions:

                >>> g_chain = True
                >>> a() # doctest: +REPORT_UDIFF +ELLIPSIS
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                    c(): d()
                    d(): e()
                    e(): raise Exception( 'e(): deliberate error')
                Exception: e(): deliberate error
                <BLANKLINE>
                The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                    ...
                    <module>(): a() # doctest: +REPORT_UDIFF +ELLIPSIS
                    a(): b()
