HELPMATE_AI Semantic Search System

INTRODUCTION
------------
HELPMATE_AI is a sophisticated semantic search system designed to efficiently retrieve and rank documents based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This system leverages advanced NLP techniques to process PDF documents and provide relevant information in response to user queries.

FEATURES
--------
- Semantic search using RAG pipeline for precise document retrieval.
- PDF text and table extraction with vector representation generation.
- Cache implementation to enhance retrieval performance.
- Vector storage with ChromaDB for scalable search capabilities.
