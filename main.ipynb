    "The PDF document needs to be effectively processed, cleaned, and chunked for the embeddings. Here, the choice of the chunking strategy will have a large impact on the final quality of the retrieved results. So, make sure that you try out various stratgies and compare their performances.Another important aspect in the embedding layer is the choice of the embedding model. You can choose to embed your chunks using the OpenAI embedding model or any model from the SentenceTransformers library on HuggingFace. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  The Search Layer: \n",
    "Here, you first need to design at least 3 queries against which you will test your system. You need to understand and skim through the document, and accordingly come up with some queries, the answers to which can be found in the policy document.Next, you need to embed the queries and search your ChromaDB vector database against each of these queries. Implementing a cache mechanism is also mandatory.Finally, you need to implement the re-ranking block, and for this you can choose from a range of cross-encoding models on HuggingFace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.  The Generation Layer:\n",
    "In the generation layer, the final prompt that you design is the major component. Make sure that the prompt is exhaustive in its instructions, and the relevant information is correctly passed to the prompt. You may also choose to provide some few-shot examples in an attempt to improve the LLM output.\n"

    "Following the pre-processing and chunking of document text, we'll generate vector representations using a suitable text embedding model. Previously, we employed the Sentence Transformer library and the all-MiniLM-L6-V2 model for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we'll showcase OpenAI's text embedding model – specifically, the ada002 v2 model, which creates 1,536-dimensional vector representations of text. ChromaDB's utility functions are leveraged to utilize OpenAI's model for generating embeddings. Refer to the documentation for more details: https://docs.trychroma.com/embeddings#openai\n",
    "\n",
    "Once generated, we'll store the embeddings within ChromaDB, our vector database. As explored earlier, Chroma collections need to be established before adding documents. Akshay utilized the get_or_create_collections method to either create a new collection or retrieve an existing one. This ensures the collection is available for storing documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're using OpenAI embeddings instead of Chroma's default option, the embedding function needs to be passed during collection creation. Finally, the collection is populated with information, including the document list, text content, and any metadata. Additionally, Akshay created a separate Chroma collection for caching, which we'll explore in a later section."

    "\n",
    "Caching significantly improves search performance by reducing the load on the main vector database for frequently occurring or similar queries. By storing results in the cache, the system can return them quickly without needing to re-execute the search on the entire database every time.\n",

    "#### A semantic cache stores the meaning or intent of a query and its corresponding response, rather than just the raw data. This significantly reduces the number of queries the main database needs to process by leveraging previously executed queries and their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Improved Performance with Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "The cache system acts as an intermediary, bypassing the semantic search layer which can be a performance bottleneck. It can directly provide responses for previously encountered queries stored in the cache collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cache Lookup and Fallback\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user submits a query, the system first generates its vector representation and searches the cache collection. If a match is found, the cached response is retrieved and returned to the user, delivering a faster response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cache Update and Main Collection Search\n",
    "\n",
    "If the query isn't found in the cache (cache miss), the system performs a search on the main collection to identify the top k most relevant documents or chunks for that query. These results are then returned to the user and simultaneously stored in the cache along with the original query, enriching the cache for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cache Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "By monitoring and customizing the cache's performance, we can further enhance its efficiency. Since the cache stores the meaning and results of past queries, it can retrieve them quickly without additional processing. This translates to faster response times and a smoother user experience."

    "\n",
    "While semantic search retrieves relevant documents, their order might not perfectly reflect their true relevance to the query.  Re-ranking can significantly improve the quality of search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Query-Response Pairs: Each retrieved document (response) is paired with the original user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Cross-Encoder Scoring: These pairs are then fed into a cross-encoder, a neural network model that assesses the semantic similarity between the query and the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Improved Ranking: Based on the scores from the cross-encoder, the documents are re-ranked, placing the most relevant ones at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the final results are not only semantically similar to the query but also the most relevant within that set of similar documents.\n",

    "#### 3.2 Refining Results with Re-Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-ranking is an important step in building a robust semantic search pipeline. While our system retrieves the top K documents relevant to the user's query, the information quality within these documents can vary.  Some retrieved documents might not perfectly capture the user's intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 The Role of Re-Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "The re-ranking stage addresses this by meticulously evaluating the top K results. It verifies how well each document aligns with the user's query and assigns an importance score to reflect its relevance. This process ensures the most relevant and informative documents are presented at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4 Benefits of Re-Ranking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance: Re-ranking improves the overall accuracy and relevance of the retrieved results by prioritizing the most valuable documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Reduced Noise: It minimizes the amount of irrelevant or inaccurate information presented to the user, leading to a more focused search experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Personalized Results: Re-ranking can potentially personalize search results by considering factors beyond strict relevance, potentially tailoring them to specific tasks or domains (depending on the implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Common Re-Ranking Methods: Traditionally, various re-ranking methods have been employed in search, including Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), hybrid search approaches, and cross-encoder models. For this project, we'll focus on the popular technique of using cross-encoders for re-ranking.\n"

    "\n",
    "In our semantic search pipeline, we'll utilize a cross-encoder model for re-ranking. Cross-encoders are neural networks specifically designed to assess the semantic similarity between two text pieces (query and document in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.6 Output Scores: Reflecting Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, cross-encoders might have primarily output scores in the range of 0 to 1, where higher values indicated greater similarity between the query and the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, advancements in cross-encoder models have led to a wider range of possible output scores, potentially including positive and negative values.  Positive scores continue to represent similarity, while negative scores now explicitly indicate dissimilarity. This wider range of scores can provide more nuanced information for re-ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.7 Cross-Encoder Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the input format for cross-encoders typically requires a list of lists.  For re-ranking, this translates to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer List: Represents all the top K retrieved documents (results) after the initial semantic search stage.\n",
    "Inner Lists: Each inner list within the outer list represents a single document (response) paired with the original user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By feeding these pairs into the cross-encoder, we obtain similarity scores that guide the re-ranking process."

    "\n",
    "### 2. Role:\n",
    "You are a helpful assistant specialized in the insurance domain, capable of answering user queries about insurance policies and related documents effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Context:\n",
    "When a user poses a question encapsulated in {query}, your task involves referencing search results from a corpus of insurance documents contained in the dataframe {top_3_INS}. These search results typically consist of a single page from an insurance policy document, potentially relevant to the user's query. The column documents in this dataframe contains the actual text from the insurance policy, while the metadata column includes details like the policy name and the source page. Documents may also feature tables formatted as lists of lists, where each nested list represents a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Task:\n",
    "Utilize the documents in {top_3_INS} to address the user's query [query]. Provide a comprehensive and informative response, leveraging the dataframe to cite relevant policy names and page numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "When possible, provide specific numerical data if mentioned in the documents.\n",
    "Focus only on information pertinent to the user's question from the dataframe; extraneous data can be omitted.\n",
    "If tables containing relevant data are present, reformat these tables and include the transformed information in your response.\n",
    "Use the metadata column to accurately cite the policy names and page numbers.\n",
    "If a complete answer is not feasible, offer guidance on how the user might locate the necessary information within the cited documents.\n",
    "Maintain a customer-centric approach in your responses, avoiding references to internal processes or irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Output Format:\n",
    "Directly address the user's query in your response, ensuring clarity and conciseness. If a query falls outside the scope of the insurance domain, clearly state that the query is irrelevant. Present your response in a well-structured and readable format, followed by citations. Start with the full response including all pertinent information, then list the citations.\n",

By using the user's query and a carefully crafted prompt, the model can generate a direct response to the query, including specific citations. This approach allows us to provide concise, relevant answers rather than returning entire pages or large segments of text."
